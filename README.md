# Kute_blob2sheep
SVG morph animation using Kute.js and BBH black sheep Logo
## Description

- This project is a a test for the KUTE.js library
- I built this project to develop SVG animation skills.
- This project helped me learn how to morph complex multi node SVGs with a free library.

### SVG animation: creating motion graphic animations using minimal file sizes.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT Websites with motion graphics
SO THAT our sites are attractive to viewers and hold attention
```

### Acceptance Criteria

* The page is a cyclical animation between SVGs of sheep and blob
* Making a scalable vector graphic animation is relatively simple provided the two shapes contain an identical number of nodes between vectors.
* If the graphics contain a different number of nodes and vectors, morphing between the two involves extremely complex math to blend nodes and vectors together to form each shape.
* The KUTE.js library has a built-in tween method which carries out the complex math involved in morphing between complex shapes.
* In this instance the short amount of JavaScript is added directly into the HTML page.
* Colours and animation timing is easily adjusted with contextual parameters inside the from to method.

*In addition, the mix blend mode on the text, set to difference, creates an interesting "colour flip" enhancing the animation. 

## Installation

This is a basic static front-end website deployment which can be deployed on any server or client with a browser. [The GIThub page deployment](https://essexgit.github.io/Kute_blob2sheep/)
